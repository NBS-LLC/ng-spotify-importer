Import CSV and Slacker Radio playlists into Spotify.

## Prerequisites

* [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) 
* Chrome or Chromium - ensure CHROME_BIN env var is exported

Note: Chrom* must match the [version](https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/download-chromium) of the ChromeDriver. Firewall warnings on macOS can be fixed by [signing](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/issues/4752#issuecomment-586599843) the app.

## Install

Run `nvm use` and then `npm install`.

## Development server

Run `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm run test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

**Note:** Runs automatically when starting the development server.

Unit test configuration is based on the following environment variables:

* CHROME_BIN

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `npm run e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [WDIO](http://webdriver.io).

**Note:** The development server must be running.

* CHROME_BIN
* SPOTIFY_AUTH_TOKEN_PRIMARY - used to sign into Spotify and grant access

To get a Spotify Auth Token do the following:

The Spotify Client ID and Secret are located in the settings of the [development](https://developer.spotify.com/) dashboard.
