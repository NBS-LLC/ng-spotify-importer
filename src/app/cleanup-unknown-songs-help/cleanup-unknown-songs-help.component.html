<h1 mat-dialog-title>Help - Cleanup Unknown Songs</h1>

<div mat-dialog-content>
    <p>Cleanup Unknown Songs is an experimental feature. When used it removes special characters from unknown songs.</p>

    <p>The idea being that the "cleaned up" songs will then be found (known).</p>

    <p>The following cleanup occurs on each unknown song's title and artist:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>the parenthesis portion is removed</li>
        <li>the ampersand (&) portion is removed</li>
        <li>single quotes (') are removed</li>
        <li>the "featuring" portion is removed</li>
    </ul>
