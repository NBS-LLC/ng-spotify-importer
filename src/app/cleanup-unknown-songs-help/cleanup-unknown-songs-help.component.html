<h1 mat-dialog-title>Help - Cleanup Unknown Songs</h1>

<div mat-dialog-content>
    <p>
        Cleanup Unknown Songs is an experimental feature. When enabled it removes special characters from unknown song
        titles and artist names.
    </p>

    <p>The idea being that the "cleaned up" songs will then be found (known).</p>

    <p>
        The following cleanup occurs on each unknown song:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>the parenthesis portion of the song title is removed</li>
        <li>the ampersand (&) portion from song title and artist name is removed</li>
        <li>single quotes (') from the title and artist name are removed</li>
        <li>the "featuring" portion of the song title is removed</li>
    </ul>
